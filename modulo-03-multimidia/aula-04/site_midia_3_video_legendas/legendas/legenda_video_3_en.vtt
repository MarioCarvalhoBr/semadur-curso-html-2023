00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.410
It's been a long time since we wanted

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.419
record a video showing how it's done

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.029
powdered milk and then on several visits that

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.500
I did it here in mauá

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.599
I discovered that you can do it here at the plant

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.280
pilot is a place that is part of the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.259
food engineering laboratory and

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.610
where students can see in practice

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.320
these equipment that exist

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.029
big industries if you don't know the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.830
harm to the institute located in São Caetano

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.869
from the south, 30 minutes from the center of São

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:24,480
paulo and is well known for its courses

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,420
engineering but it's much more than that

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.490
the bike has more than 100 laboratories and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.990
In addition to engineering, there is also

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.270
administration and design and it is logical to

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.170
milk powder making machine before

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.149
I'm here with Professor Edson
